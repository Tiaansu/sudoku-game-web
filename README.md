# Sudoku

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

The code is from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpsm3tOLTVE) video, and I'm planning to re-create this soon when I have enough knowledge in html, css, and javascript.
